# Uric acid project 

This repository contains the data processing scripts of the FARMM metagenomics analysis. 

To run the script, download both the `uric_acid_project.R` script and the `BiG-MAP.map.meta.dec.biom` file. In the R script, modify line 15 to refer to the location of the BiG-MAP BIOM file.
